The effective management of information related to the collection, screening, distribution and use of safe blood products is a critical element for all blood services. The Blood Safety Information System (*BSIS*) is an open source information system designed to manage donor and blood safety information from the point of donor registration to donation collection, through to laboratory testing, component processing and labelling, storage, and distribution to hospitals and clinics. The BSIS tool is primarily targeted for deployment in resource-limited countries and supports the Africa Society for Blood Transfusion (AfSBT) 3 step certification and accreditation process and recommended best practice.

1. **Donor management module**: which is able to operate as a stand-alone module [1]_, that manages information about donors, including deferrals and adverse events, donation collection, post-donation counselling and the TTI, blood grouping and serology testing processes


2. **Blood management module**: that extends the system to incorporate blood component processing, pack labelling, discards, inventory management, transfers, issues and returns. BSIS can be implemented either by implementing the donor management module first followed by the blood management module or as the full blood safety application, according to the needs and preferences of the blood service
